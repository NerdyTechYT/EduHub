EduHub

Warning: This project is a work-in-progress and may not work perfectly at the moment.

EduHub is a simple, educational-focused version of YouTube that I built to learn fundamental web development skills. It runs entirely locally in your browser and does not have a user account system. The project heavily relies on localStorage to store data.

Features

Browse and watch educational videos locally

Simple interface inspired by YouTube

Fully client-side; no backend database

Notes

This is not a public platform â€” it is meant for learning and experimentation.

If enough people find it useful, I might make an official version with a proper database and full functionality in the future.

Currently, the project may have bugs and incomplete features.

Usage

Download the project.

Open index.html in your browser.

Explore the local educational videos.

Purpose

I built this project to practice HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and working with browser storage. It's a personal learning project, so feel free to explore and learn from it too!
